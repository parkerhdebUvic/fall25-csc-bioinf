# AI Usage (Week 1)

Models / versions
- ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking), used between 2025-09-13 and 2025-09-14.

Prompts / tasks
- “Convert this Python assembler to Codon; keep behavior identical; avoid pathlib/os.path; remove matplotlib.”
- “Write evaluate.sh that runs python + codon, times them, computes N50, outputs a table.”
- “Help compute N50 from stdout.”

Key instructions applied
- Avoid non-portable stdlib in Codon (pathlib, os.path, sys.path hacks).
- Remove matplotlib from Codon copy.
- Add deterministic N50 parsing (ignore header lines).
- Accept that contig lists may differ; compare via N50.

Files influenced
- `week1/code/code_codon/*` (Codon ports)
- `week1/evaluate.sh`
- `week1/code/n50_helper.py`
